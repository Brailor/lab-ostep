# Notes on Virtual memory

When I tried running the `va` program it printed out the following virtal adresses:

- location of the program: 0x105414ed0
- location of the heap: 0x600002e3c020
- location of the stack: 0x7ff7baaee18c

What is interesting it that how 'close' the head and the stack are in terms of memory size.

Why is the program and the heap so 'far' away from each other?
